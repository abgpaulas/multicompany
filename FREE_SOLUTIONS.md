### **Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)**

Use GitHub storage for production + backup system as fallback.

## 🚀 Quick Start (GitHub Storage)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Token (2 minutes)
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name: "Render File Storage"
4. Expiration: "No expiration"
5. Scopes: Check ✅ `repo` and ✅ `public_repo`
6. Generate and **copy the token**

### Step 2: Configure Render (1 minute)
In Render dashboard → Environment tab, add:
```
USE_GITHUB=True
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
GITHUB_REPO_NAME=abgpaulas/multicompany
GITHUB_BRANCH=master
```

### Step 3: Deploy
Your changes are already pushed! Render will automatically deploy.

### Step 4: Test
1. Upload an image in your app
2. Check your GitHub repository
3. You'll see a `media/` folder with your files!
