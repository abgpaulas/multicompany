## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

Your image upload issue has been **completely resolved**! Images will now update immediately across all apps when you upload them.

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### 1. **GitHub Storage Integration**
- ✅ Enhanced GitHub storage backend with better error handling

### 2. **Cache-Busting System**

- ✅ Updated all templates to use cache-busting URLs

### 3. **Context Processor Improvements**
- ✅ Fixed `get_safe_media_url` function to work with GitHub storage
- ✅ Added `get_media_url_with_cache_bust` function
- ✅ Updated company context to use cache-busting URLs

### 4. **Template Updates**
- ✅ Updated `base.html` sidebar logo with cache-busting
- ✅ Updated `dashboard.html` company logo with cache-busting

## 🚀 **How It Works Now:**
